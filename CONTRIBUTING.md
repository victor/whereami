Guidelines for Contributing/Installation
========================================

---

Building whereami yourself, for use or development, you will need [Cocoapods](http://cocoapods.org/). After you clone the repository, run the following command inside the repository root (directory containing the Podfile file):

```
pod install
```

and open whereami.xcworkspace in Xcode. Refer to the official Cocoapods guide if you need more instructions on its installation, setup, and usage.
